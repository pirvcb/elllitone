// I have spent the last 2.5 years exploring this library, finding the atmega328s strong and weak points when processing realtime audio 

// In the following program, I attempted to squeeze as much Mozzi functionality into a single device, paired with a simple "patch and play" interface. 

// Currently, this program uses 99.99% of the atmega328 program storage space. This includes the 6 WaveTable files that represent the WaveForm Shapes  <tables/AKWF_.....h>

//You might be asking "can I use my own waveforms?". Creating custom waveforms for use in mozzi is not a simple or straightforward process. Still, you can look more into this process 
//by reading through the Mozzi Forum Google Group.

//However, replacing the initial 6 Waveforms with other waveforms from the AKWF library is simple and straightforward! This library contains hundreds of waveshapes that 
//can all be viewed here:   https://www.adventurekid.se/AKRTfiles/AKWF/view/waveforms_index.html

//to replace the waveforms, First download and install the Arduino IDE:  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

//Next, download and unzip the Mozzi file. Take the unzipped Mozzi folder and place it inside the "libraries" folder located within the Arduino Folder, (usually found in My Documents). 

//Now, make sure you have successfully installed the CH340 Driver. This driver allows your computer to communicate with the Ellitones atmega328.
//If installed correctly, your computer should recognize the Arduino when plugged into USB and it will show up as a COM in Tools-Port menu in Arduino IDE

//Now, Navigate to Documents > Arduino > libraries > Mozzi-1.0.3rc6 > tables
//Scroll down until you start seeing the files that start with "AKWF" these are all the possible waveforms you can choose from!

//Next, in the #include section below, copy in the waveshape files you want to use instead of the 6 that are currently there.  

//Next, Around Code Line ~93 (current line code # is in bottom left hand corner of Arduino IDE window) make sure that one of your new wavetables is used here instead of old waveform! 
//Code Line ~246, make sure that one of your new wavetables is used here aswell! 

//Lastly, Code Line ~869 through ~946 is where the actual switching between waveforms happen when you connect different outputs to the WaveForm input. 
//This is where you will put in all your new selected waveform files! 

//If you wish to try adding new features and modes, one way to quickly free up a bunch of space (to work with) is to #include and use LESS than 6 WaveForms. 
//You can just use 1 waveform file in all the places listed above and free up ~40% more space for added logic functions!  

//I am more than happy to further explain the following code and its workings if people are interested in taking this device even further!
